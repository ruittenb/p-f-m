- cursor at 'lib', sort by name with mouse click: cursor ends up
  at 'lib-app-pfm'

- si(Z)e does not work correctly because a restat() is done afterwards
- handlecopyrename: after overwrite? -> no, then cursor is moved anyway

- (L)ink (R)el on '.' or '..' fail to create correct link because of
  canonicalize_pathname()

- (T)ime etc. do not resort(); should they?
  if ($sort_mode =~ /[da]/i)
  	$screen->set_deferred_refresh(R_DIRSORT | R_DIRLISTING);
  }

- after (C)opy, the rcs status is not automatically added 

- 'editor' option niet van kracht na (M)ore (C)onfig
