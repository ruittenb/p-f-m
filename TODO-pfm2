- cursor at 'lib', sort by name with mouse click: cursor ends up
  at 'lib-app-pfm'

- si(Z)e does not work correctly because a restat() is done afterwards

- handlecopyrename: after overwrite? -> no, then cursor is moved anyway

- (M)ore (S)how same dir: doesn't remove marks

- (L)ink (R)el on '.' or '..' fail to create correct link because of
  canonicalize_pathname()

- after (C)opy, the rcs status is not automatically added
