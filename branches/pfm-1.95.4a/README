to rename your ~/.pfm/.pfmrc and compare it with the default config file
that pfm automatically generates for you.


Notes:

* As of version 1.92.6, the meaning of the 'defaultdotmode' option
  has been inverted. 'dot_mode' set now means that dotfiles *will* be shown.

* As of version 1.92.0, the config file has been extended with options
  necessary for the launch functionality. Please check the new options in
  the default config file.

* As of version 1.91.7, the column layouts in your .pfmrc need to specify
  the location of the diskinfo column. You may update your .pfmrc using
  the script 'mend_diskinfo.pl'.

* As of version 1.91.6, the 'dircolors[]' and 'framecolors[]' option values
  may use both numerical values and color names.
  You may use the script 'mend_colors.pl' if you want to convert the
  color codes in your old .pfmrc to colornames.

* As of version 1.89, quoting behavior has changed. You will have
  to remove the double quotes around \1, \2 etc. in your config file.
  The script 'mend_quotes.pl' is provided to convert your .pfmrc to the
  new format.

* As of version 1.84, the (Y)our commands must be specified in a different
  format. Use the script 'mend_your_cmnds.pl' if you want to convert the
  (Y)our commands in your old .pfmrc to the new format.

* On HP-UX 11.00, the file /etc/termcap does not seem to contain an 'me'
  entry. You need to add it in order to make Term::Screen function
  correctly, for example :me=\E[0m:
