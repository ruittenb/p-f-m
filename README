* On Ubuntu Jaunty, it is advisable to install the following packages:
  libncurses5
  libncurses5-dev
  libreadline5
  libreadline5-dev
  libterm-readline-gnu-perl

* If you are upgrading from an older version, please update your
  ~/.pfm/.pfmrc by running the script 'pfmrcupdate'.
  You are strongly advised to rename your .pfmrc and compare it with
  the default config file that pfm automatically generates for you.

* On HP-UX 11.00, the file /etc/termcap does not seem to contain an 'me'
  entry. You need to add it in order to make Term::Screen function
  correctly, for example :me=\E[0m:
