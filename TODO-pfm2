- cursor at 'lib', sort by name with mouse click: cursor ends up
  at 'lib-app-pfm'

- si(Z)e does not work correctly because a restat() is done afterwards
- handlecopyrename: after overwrite? -> no, then cursor is moved anyway

- (L)ink (R)el on '.' or '..' fail to create correct link because of
  canonicalize_pathname()

- (T)ime etc. do not resort(); should they?
  if ($sort_mode =~ /[da]/i)
  	$screen->set_deferred_refresh(R_DIRSORT | R_DIRLISTING);
  }

- after (C)opy, the rcs status is not automatically added 

- 'editor' option niet van kracht na (M)ore (C)onfig

- after handledelete in multiple mode, it is possible that so many entries
  have been deleted that the cursor target (position_at) is completely
  off-screen. Somehow, this is not corrected by validate_position() and the
  cursor ends up at line 0.

- F7 to same directory: no refresh is done, so the marks stay in place.

- rename R_DIRCONTENTS, R_DIRSORT, R_DIRFILTER to D_ constants (directory/dirty)
  set_dirty_flag() etc.
