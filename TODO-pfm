# issues

- config columnlayouts: characters in the "gap" between filerecord and
  infocolumn ("f") are not cleared when switching columnlayouts.
  Solve this by inserting an artificial "gap" field?

- handlecopyrename: if "overwrite?" is answered with "no", then the
  cursor is repositioned anyway

- (M)ore (S)how same dir: doesn't remove marks
  -> is this due to the fact that Directory::_clone() does not clone the files?
  -> handleswap() has different conditions for executing its blocks

- after (C)opy, the rcs status is not automatically added 

- Term::ScreenColor does not pass some tests on Solaris 11
- release 1.15 with fix for color2esc('')

- call $pfm->checkupdates() in '@' (perlcommand) does not finish the job;
  call $pfm->checkupdates(); sleep 2; finishes it.

# structural enhancements

- Config->apply: call separate class's import() routines and have them import
  the config options that are interesting for them.
  Or use events.

- restructure chdir(), handleswap()/handlemoreshow()/handlemorego() etc.
- check function of $swapping flag behavior
- "Setting the current directory with App::PFM::Directory::path is identical to
  calling App::PFM::Directory::chdir()" -> maybe uncouple these two?

- add a 'is_main' flag to directories so that they know if a job event may
  trigger a screen update
  or use an event: 'determine_main_status'???

- have directories keep track of their own background jobs

- make our() variables member variables

- standardize the names of constants
  Config::READ_FIRST?

- have objects (Directory) fire an event to indicate that the current position
  is to be saved ('save_cursor_position' -> position_at())

- extract abstract code so that browser may be reused for bookmarks and your
  commands; ideally:
  - Screen/Listing/Files
  - Screen/Listing/Bookmarks
  - Screen/Listing/YourCommands
  - Browser/Files
  - Browser/Bookmarks
  - Browser/YourCommands

- move CommandHandler::_listbookmarks() to Screen/Listing/Bookmarks::list()

- who determines which command was clicked in the menu?
  is that the CommandHandler::handlemousefooter* or Screen::Frame?

# functional enhancements

- intercept bursts of input

- keep marks when F5 refreshing

- if a file is copied/moved/linked to =5, add it to the swap state

- introduce SIGQUIT for interrupt multi?

- add -o commandline option for starting with a certain sort mode

- add colors like dircolors(1) for sticky, setuid etc. and extensions

- figure out and display if an ACL is applicable for a file

################################################################################
# documentation enhancements

- add constants MENU_* HEADING_* etc. to uml

- rename "format" to "layout" everywhere

- manpages: update formatting of arguments.
