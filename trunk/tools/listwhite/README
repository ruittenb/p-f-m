listwhite is an optional tool for listing the names of whiteout files.

This tool is *only* useful on filesystems that support this feature,
like unionfs, tfs (translucent filesystem), ovlfs (overlay filesystem)
or ifs (inheriting filesystem).

If you don't use any of these filesystems, you can skip the
installation of listwhite.
