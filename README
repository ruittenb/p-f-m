If you are upgrading from an older version, you are strongly advised
to rename your ~/.pfm/.pfmrc and compare it with the default config file
that pfm automatically generates for you.


Notes:

* As of version 1.84, the (Y)our commands must be specified in a different
  format. Use the script 'mend_your_cmnds.pl' if you want to convert the
  (Y)our commands in your old .pfmrc to the new format.

* As of version 1.83, pfm now respects your current locale settings.
  If you are not concerned with this, you may want to set your environment
  variable LC_ALL to the value 'C'.

* In pre-1.83 versions, there was no need to explicitly state some bold
  and reverse rendering of the frame (header, footer, titlebar).  As of
  version 1.83, this formatting must now explicitly be specified in the
  .pfmrc config file.
