* If you are upgrading from an older version, you need to update your
  config file (~/.pfm/.pfmrc).
  This can be done quickly by running the script 'pfmrcupdate'.
  However, for a more thorough update, you are advised to rename your
  .pfmrc and compare it to the default config file that pfm automatically
  generates for you.
