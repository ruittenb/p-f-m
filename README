* If you are not sure if you have all the dependencies, you can run
  the 'install.sh' shell script. Otherwise, you can go straight to the
  'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; sudo make install' phase.

* If you are upgrading from an older version, you need to update your
  config file (~/.pfm/.pfmrc).
  This can be done quickly by running the script 'pfmrcupdate'.
  However, for a more thorough update, you are advised to rename your
  .pfmrc and compare it to the default config file that pfm automatically
  generates for you.
