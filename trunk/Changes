Version 1.54-oleg.

These are changes proposed by Oleg Bartunov (oleg@sai.msu.su).
They eventually found their way into pfm, albeit in a different implementation.

* Toggle screenwidth (implemented as configurable columnlayouts in combination with the SIGWINCH handler)
* Don't sort '.' and '..' entries (implemented as 'dotdotmode')
* Case-sensitive Your commands (implemented in version 1.83)
* In c(O)mmand, don't invoke the shell implicitly (implemented as (M)ore - s(H)ell)
* Toggle show/hide dotfiles (implemented as '.' command, preserving marks)
