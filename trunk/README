libncurses5
libncurses5-dev

libterm-readline-gnu-perl


If you are upgrading from an older version, please update your ~/.pfm/.pfmrc
by running the script 'pfmrcupdate'.
You are strongly advised to rename your .pfmrc and compare it with
the default config file that pfm automatically generates for you.


Notes:

* As of version 1.92.6, the meaning of the 'defaultdotmode' option
  has been inverted. 'dot_mode' set now means that dotfiles *will* be shown.

* As of version 1.92.0, the config file has been extended with options
  necessary for the launch functionality. Please check the new options in
  the default config file.

* On HP-UX 11.00, the file /etc/termcap does not seem to contain an 'me'
  entry. You need to add it in order to make Term::Screen function
  correctly, for example :me=\E[0m:
