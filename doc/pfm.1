.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR is a terminal-based file manager, based on \s-1PFM\s0.COM for MS-DOS.
.PP
All \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR commands are accessible through one or two keystrokes, and a few
are accessible with the mouse. Most command keys are case-insensitive. \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR
can operate in single-file mode or multiple-file mode. In single-file mode,
the command corresponding to the keystroke will be performed on the current
(highlighted) file only. In multiple-file mode, the command will apply to
a selection of files.
.PP
Note that throughout this manual page, \fIfile\fR can mean any type of file,
not just plain regular files. These will be referred to as \fIregular files\fR.
.PP \" display the 'pertains to'-macro

.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
Most of \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR's configuration is read from a config file. The default
location for this file is \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.pfm/.pfmrc\fR, but an alternative location
may be specified using the environment variable \s-1PFMRC\s0. If there is no
config file present at startup, one will be created. The file contains
many comments on the available options, and is therefore supposed to be
self-explanatory. \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will issue a warning if the version number of an
existing config file is less than the version of \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR you are running, and
will offer to update it to its own version.  Alternatively, you could let
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR create a new default config file and compare the changes with your
own settings, so that you can configure the new options right away. See
also the \fBC\fRonfig command under \*(L"\s-1MORE\s0 \s-1COMMANDS\s0\*(R" below, and \*(L"\s-1DIAGNOSIS\s0\*(R".
.PP
There are two commandline options that specify starting directories.
The \s-1CDPATH\s0 environment variable is taken into account when \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR
tries to find these directories.
.IP "\fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "directory"
The directory that \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR should initially use as its main directory. If
unspecified, the current directory is used.
.IP "\-\-help" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print extended usage information, then exit.
.IP "\-c, \-\-colorset \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --colorset string"
Start \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR using the specified colorset (as defined in the \fI.pfmrc\fR).
.IP "\-l, \-\-layout \fInumber\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --layout number"
Start \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR using the specified column layout (as defined in the \fI.pfmrc\fR).
.IP "\-\-login" 4
.IX Item "--login"
Start \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR as a login shell. \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will change its name to \f(CW\*(C`\-pfm\*(C'\fR
and start a new session using \fIsetsid()\fR.
.IP "\-o, \-\-sort \fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o, --sort mode"
Start \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR using the specified sort mode (as shown by the \fBF6\fR command).
.IP "\-s, \-\-swap \fIdirectory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s, --swap directory"
The directory that \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR should initially use as swap directory. (See
also below, under the \fBF7\fR command).
.Sp
There would be no point in setting the swap directory and subsequently
returning to the main directory if 'persistentswap' is turned off in your
config file. Therefore, \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will swap back to the main directory \fIonly\fR
if 'persistentswap' is turned on.
.IP "\-\-usage" 4
.IX Item "--usage"
Print concise usage information, then exit.
.IP "\-\-version" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print current version, then exit.
.SH "NAVIGATION"
.IX Header "NAVIGATION"
Navigation through directories is essentially done using the arrow keys
and the \fIvi\fR\|(1) cursor keys (\fBhjkl\fR). The following additional navigation
keys are available:
.PP
Movement inside a directory:
.in +4n
.TS
lw(20n) | lw(41n).

Movement between directories:
.in +4n
.TS
lw(20n) | lw(41n).
_
\fBl\fP, \fIright arrow\fP	\fIchdir()\fP to a subdirectory
\fBh\fP, \fIleft arrow\fP	\fIchdir()\fP to the parent directory
\fBENTER\fP	\fIchdir()\fP to a subdirectory
\fBESC\fP, \fBBS\fP	\fIchdir()\fP to the parent directory
_
.TE
.in
.PP
If the option 'chdirautocmd' has been specified in the \fI.pfmrc\fR file,
pfm will execute that command after every \fIchdir()\fR. This can be used
\&\fIe.g.\fR to set the title of an xterm window.
.PP
Note: the \fBl\fR and \fB\s-1ENTER\s0\fR keys function differently when the cursor
is on a non-directory file (see below under \fBL\fRink and
\&\*(L"\s-1LAUNCHING\s0 \s-1FILES\s0\*(R" respectively).
.SH "COMMANDS"
.IX Header "COMMANDS"
.IP "\fBAttribute\fR" 4
.IX Item "Attribute"
Changes the mode of the file if you are the owner. The mode may be specified
either symbolically or numerically, see \fIchmod\fR\|(1) for more details.
.Sp
Note 1: the mode on a symbolic link cannot be set. See \fIchmod\fR\|(1) for more
details.
.Sp
Note 2: the name \fBAttribute\fR for this command is a reminiscence of the \s-1DOS\s0
version.
.IP "\fBCopy\fR" 4
.IX Item "Copy"
Copy current file. You will be prompted for the destination filename.
Directories will be copied recursively with all underlying files.
.Sp
In multiple-file mode, it is not allowed to specify a single non-directory
filename as a destination. Instead, the destination name must be a
directory or a name containing a \fB=1\fR, \fB=2\fR or \fB=7\fR escape (see below
under c\fBO\fRmmand).
.Sp
If clobber mode is off (see below under the \fB!\fR command), existing files
will not be overwritten unless the action is confirmed by the user.
.Sp
Whether \fBC\fRopy follows symlinks or copies them is OS-specific; you can
change the default behavior by setting the 'copyoptions' option in your
\&\fI.pfmrc\fR. See \fIcp\fR\|(1).
.IP "\fBDelete\fR" 4
.IX Item "Delete"
Delete a file or directory. You must confirm this command with \fBY\fR
to actually delete the file. If the current file is a directory which
contains files, and you want to delete it recursively, you must respond with
\&\fBA\fRffirmative to the additional prompt. Lost files (files on the screen
but not actually present on disk) can be deleted from the screen listing
without confirmation. Whiteouts cannot be deleted; use un\fBW\fRhiteout for
this purpose.
.IP "\fBEdit\fR" 4
.IX Item "Edit"
Edit a file with your external editor. You can specify an editor with the
environment variable \s-1VISUAL\s0 or \s-1EDITOR\s0 or with the 'editor' option
in the \fI.pfmrc\fR file. Otherwise \fIvi\fR\|(1) is used.
.Sp
If a capital \fBE\fR is pressed, the foreground editor is used ('fg_editor').
.IP "\fBFind\fR" 4
.IX Item "Find"
If the current sort mode is by filename, you are prompted for a (partial)
filename. While you type, the cursor is positioned on the best match.
Type \fB\s-1ENTER\s0\fR to end typing.
.Sp
If the current sort mode is not by filename, then you are prompted for a
filename. The cursor is then positioned on that file.
.IP "\fBtarGet\fR" 4
.IX Item "tarGet"
Allows you to change the target that a symbolic link points to. You must
have permission to remove the current symbolic link.
.IP "\fBInclude\fR" 4
.IX Item "Include"
Allows you to mark a group of files which meet a certain criterion:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBA\fRfter / \fBB\fRefore" 4
.IX Item "After / Before"
files newer/older than a specified date and time
.IP "\fBE\fRvery file" 4
.IX Item "Every file"
all files, including dotfiles (but not the \fI.\fR and \fI..\fR entries)
.IP "\fBF\fRiles only" 4
.IX Item "Files only"
regular files of which the filenames match a specified regular expression
(not a glob pattern!)
.IP "\fBD\fRirectories only" 4
.IX Item "Directories only"
all directories (but not the \fI.\fR and \fI..\fR entries)
.IP "\fBG\fRreater / \fBS\fRmaller" 4
.IX Item "Greater / Smaller"
files that are bigger or smaller than the provided size in bytes.
.IP "\fBN\fRewmarks" 4
.IX Item "Newmarks"
files which were created during a previous multiple command and are now
denoted with a \fInewmark\fR (\fB~\fR)
.IP "\fBO\fRldmarks" 4
.IX Item "Oldmarks"
files which were marked (\fB*\fR) before a previous multiple command and are
now denoted with an \fIoldmark\fR (\fB.\fR)
.IP "\fBU\fRser" 4
.IX Item "User"
files owned by the current user
.IP "\fB.\fR" 4
.IX Item "."
all dotfiles (but not the \fI.\fR and \fI..\fR entries).
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Oldmarks and newmarks may be used to perform more than one command on the
same group of files.
.Sp
Note that the \fI.\fR and \fI..\fR entries will never automatically become marked.
.Sp
There is also the option:
.IP "\fBI\fRnvert" 4
.IX Item "Invert"
Inverts the selection, except for the \fI.\fR and \fI..\fR entries, which become
unmarked.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBLink\fR" 4
.IX Item "Link"
Prompts to create either:
.RS 4
.IP "an \fBA\fRbsolute symlink" 4
.IX Item "an Absolute symlink"
This will create a symlink containing an absolute path to the target,
irrespective of whether you enter a relative or an absolute symlink name.
.Sp
Example: when the cursor is on the file \fI/home/rene/incoming/.plan\fR,
and you request an absolute symlink to be made with either the name
\&\fI../.plan\fR or \fI/home/rene/.plan\fR, the actual symlink will become:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    /home/rene/.plan \-> /home/rene/incoming/.plan
.Ve
.IP "a \fBH\fRard link" 4
.IX Item "a Hard link"
This will create an additional hard link to the current file with the
specified name, which must be on the same filesystem (see \fIln\fR\|(1)).
.IP "a \fBR\fRelative symlink" 4
.IX Item "a Relative symlink"
This will create a symlink containing a relative path to the target,
irrespective of whether you enter a relative or an absolute symlink name.
.Sp
Example: when the cursor is on the file \fI/home/rene/incoming/.plan\fR,
and you request a relative symlink to be made with either the name
\&\fI../.plan\fR or \fI/home/rene/.plan\fR, the actual symlink will become:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    /home/rene/.plan \-> incoming/.plan
.Ve
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If a directory is specified, \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will follow the behavior of \fIln\fR\|(1),
which is to create the new link inside that directory.
.Sp
In multiple-file mode, it is not allowed to specify a single non-directory
filename as a new name. Instead, the new name must be a directory or a
name containing a \fB=1\fR, \fB=2\fR or \fB=7\fR escape (see below under c\fBO\fRmmand).
.Sp
If clobber mode is off (see below under the \fB!\fR command), existing files
will not be overwritten.
.Sp
Note that if the current file is a directory, the \fBl\fR key, being one of
the \fIvi\fR\|(1) cursor keys, will \fIchdir()\fR you into the directory. The capital \fBL\fR
command will \fIalways\fR try to make a link.
.RE
.IP "\fBMore\fR" 4
.IX Item "More"
Presents you with a choice of operations not related to the current
file. Use this \fIe.g.\fR to configure \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR, edit a new file, make a
new directory, show a different directory, or write the history files to
disk. See below under \*(L"\s-1MORE\s0 \s-1COMMANDS\s0\*(R". Pressing \fB\s-1ESC\s0\fR or \fB\s-1ENTER\s0\fR will
take you back to the main menu.
.IP "\fBName\fR" 4
.IX Item "Name"
Shows the complete long filename. For a symbolic link, this command
will also show the complete target of the symbolic link. This is useful
in case the terminal is not wide enough to display the entire name, or
if the name contains non-printable characters. Non-ASCII characters and
control characters will be displayed as their octal, decimal (html
entity-like) or hexadecimal equivalents like the examples in the following
table.
.Sp
The 'defaultradix' config file option specifies the radix that will
initially be used.  The 'defaulttranslatespace' config file option
controls whether spaces will initially be converted as well.
.Sp
When the name is shown in its converted form, pressing \fBN\fR will change
the radix, and pressing \fB\s-1SPACE\s0\fR will toggle the translation of spaces.
Any other key will exit the \fBN\fR command.
.Sp

.IP "\fBcOmmand\fR" 4
.IX Item "cOmmand"
Allows execution of a shell command. After the command completes, \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR
will resume. If the command is \f(CW\*(C`cd\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR itself will change to
that directory.
.Sp
On the commandline, you may use several special abbreviations, which
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will replace with the current filename, directoryname etc. (see
below). These abbreviations start with an escape character. This escape
character is defined with the option 'escapechar' in your \fI.pfmrc\fR
file. By default it is \fB=\fR. (Previous versions of \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR used \fB\e\fR, but
this was deemed too confusing because backslashes are parsed by the shell
as well. This manual page (and the default config file) will assume you
are using \fB=\fR as 'escapechar').
.Sp
The following abbreviations are available:
.RS 4
.IP "\fB=1\fR" 4
.IX Item "=1"
the current filename without extension (see below)
.IP "\fB=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "=2"
the current filename, complete
.IP "\fB=3\fR" 4

fork into the background. \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR uses this editor in a few cases so
that it can wait for its results.
.IP "\fB=p\fR" 4
.IX Item "=p"

.RS 4
.Sp
The \fIextension\fR of the filename is defined as follows:
.Sp
If the filename does not contain a period at all, then the file has no
extension (\fB=7\fR is empty) and its whole name is regarded as \fB=1\fR.
.Sp
If the filename does contain a period, the extension \fB=7\fR is defined
as the final part of the filename, starting at the last period in the
name. The filename \fB=1\fR is the part before the period.
.Sp
In all cases, the concatenation of \fB=1\fR and \fB=7\fR is equal to \fB=2\fR.

.IP "\fBRename\fR" 4
.IX Item "Rename"
Change the name of the file and/or move it into another directory. You will
be prompted for the new filename. Depending on your Unix implementation,
a pathname on another filesystem may or may not be allowed.
.Sp
In multiple-file mode, it is not allowed to specify a single non-directory
filename as a new name. Instead, the new name must be a directory or a
name containing a \fB=1\fR or \fB=2\fR escape (see above under c\fBO\fRmmand).

If clobber mode is off (see below under the \fB!\fR command), existing files
will not be overwritten unless the action is confirmed by the user.
.IP "\fBShow\fR" 4
.IX Item "Show"
Displays the contents of the current file or directory on screen.
You can choose which pager to use for file viewing with the environment
variable \s-1PAGER\s0, or with the 'pager' option in the \fI.pfmrc\fR file.
.IP "\fBTime\fR" 4
.IX Item "Time"
Changes mtime (modification date/time) of the file. The time may be
entered either with or without clarifying interpunction (\fIe.g.\fR
2008\-12\-04 08:42.12).  Enter \fB.\fR to set the mtime to the current

.IP "\fBUser\fR" 4
.IX Item "User"
Changes ownership of a file. Note that many Unix variants do not allow
normal (non\-\f(CW\*(C`root\*(C'\fR) users to change ownership. Symbolic links will be
followed.
.IP "\fBVersion\fR" 4
.IX Item "Version"
Updates the current file with status information of the applicable
versioning system. \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will examine the current directory to figure
out which versioning system is used. Supported versioning systems are:
Subversion, \s-1CVS\s0, Bazaar and Git.  See also \fBM\fRore \- re\fBV\fRision.
.IP "\fBunWhiteout\fR" 4

.IP "\fBYour command\fR" 4
.IX Item "Your command"
Like c\fBO\fRmmand (see above), except that it uses preconfigured commands
from the \fI.pfmrc\fR file.  These commands are identified by a single
letter (case-sensitive) or digit.

.IP "\fBsiZe\fR" 4
.IX Item "siZe"
For directories, reports the grand total (in bytes) of the directory
and its contents.
.Sp
For other file types, reports the total number of bytes in allocated
data blocks. For regular files, this is often more than the reported
file size. For special files and \fIfast symbolic links\fR, the number is
zero, as no data blocks are allocated for these file types.
.Sp
If the screen layout (selected with \fBF9\fR) does not contain the
\&'grand total' column, then the 'filesize' column will temporarily be
used instead. A 'grand total' column in the layout will never be
filled in when entering the directory.
.Sp
Note: since \fIdu\fR\|(1) commands are not portable, \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR guesses how it can
calculate the size according to the Unix variant that it runs on. If

Lists all the available bookmarks and asks the user in which slot the
current directory should be bookmarked.  If the input is valid, a new
bookmark is created in the bookmark list.
.Sp
Navigation through the bookmark list works in the same way as for
directories (see above under \*(L"\s-1NAVIGATION\s0\*(R"), except that \fB\s-1ENTER\s0\fR
selects the highlighted slot, and \fBj\fR and \fBk\fR select their own

.IP "\fBRead history/bookmarks\fR" 4
.IX Item "Read history/bookmarks"
Offers the user the choice to read the input history and/or bookmarks
from disk.
.Sp
The input history is the history of Unix commands, pathnames, regular
expressions, modification times, and file modes that the user enters.
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR uses the readline library to manage these.
.Sp
The input history is also read in when \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR starts, from individual files in
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.pfm/\fR.
.Sp
The bookmarks are also read in when \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR starts, from \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.pfm/bookmarks\fR.
.Sp
See also \fBM\fRore\-\fBW\fRrite history/bookmarks.
.IP "\fBShow directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "Show directory"

command is different from \fBF7\fR because this will not change your current
swap directory status.
.IP "\fBalTernate screen\fR" 4
.IX Item "alTernate screen"
If the terminal has an alternate screen (like \fBxterm\fR), and \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR has been
configured to use it (through the 'altscreenmode' option in the \fI.pfmrc\fR),
then this command shows the alternate screen until a key is pressed.
This is useful for reading error messages of shell commands and so on.
.IP "\fBVersion\fR" 4
.IX Item "Version"
Updates the current directory with status information of the applicable
versioning system. \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will examine the current directory to figure
out which versioning system is used. Supported versioning systems are:
Subversion, \s-1CVS\s0, Bazaar and Git.
.Sp
If you set the 'autorcs' option in your \fI.pfmrc\fR, this will automatically
be done every time \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR shows directory contents.
.IP "\fBWrite history/bookmarks\fR" 4
.IX Item "Write history/bookmarks"
Offers the user the choice to write the input history and/or bookmarks
to disk.
.Sp
The input history is also written when \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR exits and the
\&'autowritehistory' option is set in \fI.pfmrc\fR.
.Sp
The bookmarks are also written when \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR exits and the
\&'autowritebookmarks' option is set in \fI.pfmrc\fR.
.Sp
See also \fBM\fRore\-\fBR\fRead history/bookmarks.

.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR can be configured to use any combination of four methods for
determining the appropriate command. These methods are:
.IP "\fBextension\fR" 4
.IX Item "extension"
The filename extension will be translated to a file type (preferably a

.Sp
Example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    extension[*.gif]: image/gif
\&    extension[*.pdf]: application/pdf
.Ve
.Sp
Launch commands for every file type may be defined using the
\&'launch[\fIfiletype\fR]' options.

.Vb 2
\&    launch[image/gif]      : =v =2 &
\&    launch[application/pdf]: acroread =2 &
.Ve
.IP "\fBmagic\fR" 4
.IX Item "magic"
The \fIfile\fR\|(1) command will be run on the current file. Its output will

options in the config file.
.Sp
Example:

\&'defaultmousemode' option in the \fI.pfmrc\fR file, or while running using
the \fBF12\fR key) will give mouse access to the following commands:

If the config option 'mouse_moves_cursor' has been set to 'yes', a mouse
click on a non-directory will move the cursor to that file. Otherwise,
the cursor will \fIonly\fR move when a directory is clicked or the mouse
wheel is used.
.PP
The mouse wheel moves the cursor five lines per notch by default,
or one line if shift is pressed. The actual number of lines can be
configured in your \fI.pfmrc\fR using 'mousewheeljumpsize'.
.PP
Clicking button 1 on the current directory path will \fIchdir()\fR up to the
clicked ancestor directory. If the current directory was clicked, or the
device name, it will act like a \fBM\fRore \- \fBS\fRhow command.
.PP
Clicking button 2 on a directory name will open a new window like \fBM\fRore
\&\- \fBO\fRpen window.
.PP
Clicking on the column headings will sort the directory contents by that
heading. Clicking again will sort the directory in reverse order.
.PP
Clicking on \*(L"Sort\*(R" in the footer will cycle through a number of
preconfigured sort modes as defined in the config option 'sortcycle'.
.PP
Clicking on the menu or footer will execute the command that was clicked.
.PP
Clicking on one of the identity lines in the info column will toggle the
display like the \fB=\fR command does.
.PP
Mouse use will be turned off during the execution of commands.
.SH "WORKING DIRECTORY INHERITANCE"
.IX Header "WORKING DIRECTORY INHERITANCE"
Upon exit, \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR will save its current working directory in the file
\&\fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.pfm/cwd\fR, and its swap directory, if any, in \fI\f(CI$HOME\fI/.pfm/swd\fR.
This enables the user to have the calling process (shell) \*(L"inherit\*(R"
\&\f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR's current working directory, and to reinstate the swap directory
upon the next invocation.  To achieve this, you may call \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR using a
function or alias like the following:

If \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR reports that your config file might be outdated, you might be
missing some of the newer configuration options (or default values for
these). The best way to solve this is by having \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR generate a new
config file, \fIe.g.\fR by running the following command and comparing the
new config file with your original one:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    env PFMRC=~/.pfm/.pfmrc\-new pfm

Alternatively, you may reply with \fBy\fR when \f(CW\*(C`pfm\*(C'\fR offers to update the
config file for you.
.PP
If a function key like \fBF1\fR or \fBF10\fR is intercepted by your windowing
system or \s-1OS\s0, and it is not feasible to change that mapping, then you can
define an alternative key mapping (like Shift\-\fBF1\fR, Shift\-\fBF10\fR) in
your \fI.pfmrc\fR, \fIe.g.\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    keydef[*]:k1=\eeO1;2P:k10=\ee[21;2~:

Or for a specific value of \fB\s-1TERM\s0\fR:
