# issues

- from the manual of File::Spec:
  File::Spec->canonpath($path) does *not* collapse x/../y sections into y.
  This is by design. If /foo on your system is a symlink to /bar/baz, then
  /foo/../quux is actually /bar/quux, not /quux as a naive ../-removal would
  give you. If you want to do this kind of processing, you probably want Cwd's
  realpath() function to actually traverse the filesystem cleaning up paths
  like this.

- handlecopyrename: if "overwrite?" is answered with "no", then the
  cursor is repositioned anyway

- (M)ore (S)how same dir: doesn't remove marks
  -> is this due to the fact that Directory::_clone() does not clone the files?
  -> handleswap() has different conditions for executing its blocks

- after (C)opy, the rcs status is not automatically added 

- in install.sh wordt ${pkgadd} niet geinterpoleerd

- sort mode 'es': bug

- Update: give error if starting version too low

- call $pfm->checkupdates() in '@' (perlcommand) does not finish the job;
  call $pfm->checkupdates(); sleep 2; finishes it.

# structural enhancements

- Config->apply: call separate class's import() routines and have them import
  the config options that are interesting for them.
  Or use events 'apply_config'.

- restructure chdir(), handleswap()/handlemoreshow()/handlemorego() etc.
- check function of $swapping flag behavior
- "Setting the current directory with App::PFM::Directory::path is identical to
  calling App::PFM::Directory::chdir()" -> maybe uncouple these two?

- add a 'is_main' flag to directories so that they know if a job event may
  trigger a screen update
  or use an event: 'determine_main_status'???

- have directories keep track of their own background jobs

- pass events from handlemore() to handlemore*()

- make our() variables member variables
- store $browser->{_screen, _config, _main_state}; remove _pfm

- standardize the names of constants
  Config::READ_FIRST?

- have objects (Directory) fire an event to indicate that the current position
  is to be saved ('save_cursor_position' -> position_at())

- extract abstract code so that browser may be reused for bookmarks and your
  commands; ideally:
  - Screen/Listing/Files
  - Screen/Listing/Bookmarks
  - Screen/Listing/YourCommands
  - Browser/Files
  - Browser/Bookmarks
  - Browser/YourCommands

- move CommandHandler::_listbookmarks() to Screen/Listing/Bookmarks::list()

- who determines which command was clicked in the menu?
  is that the CommandHandler::handlemousefooter* or Screen::Frame?

- test Config::Update

- implement 'after_create_entry'

- use lookahead in handlemousefootercommand

- TEST: have Browser determine on which file the mouse was clicked, and pass that
  "current"file + "current"line to in the event to the CommandHandler

# functional enhancements

- intercept bursts of input

- keep marks when F5 refreshing

- if a file is copied/moved/linked to =5, add it to the swap state

- introduce SIGQUIT for interrupt multi?

- figure out and display if an ACL is applicable for a file

- add (M)ore - (O)pen window?
- add e(X)clude - (.)dotfiles?

# documentation enhancements

- manpages: use I<...> in =items
